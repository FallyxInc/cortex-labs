Effective Date: 11/17/2025 11:21 Type: Behaviour - Responsive Behaviour
Type of Behaviour : Physical expressions towards staff, such as: swatting, hitting/kicking, yelling/swearing
Antecedent/Triggers : Personal care (shower room); loss of independence and anger with acceptance of support with ADLS. The resident was
also reported to have sleep poorly last night following an outing with his wife yesterday.
Describe the behaviour : Staff reported, that the resident did not accept personal care last evening (refused multiple times with different
approaches to care). The PSW offered a PRN shower which the resident was initially accepting of. During the shower, the resident escalated
quite quickly, trying to stand up from the commode/shower chair, yelling and swearing, trying to hit and kick the staff.
Disruptiveness (Data)/Consequences to the behaviour : The resident did receive personal care with assistance from staff once settled;
however, with the expressions displayed and if consistent refusals continue, there is risk to impaired personal hygiene, risk for UTI/infections,
etc.
Interventions (review/update care plan) (Action) : The Writer and co-Behaviour Support Lead (C.C) reviewed and updated the resident's care
plan to reflect triggers and interventions; see other progress notes.
Change in medication : Change in medication last week; see Change of Medication/Treatment note from November 12th.
What are the risks and causes : With the resident attempting to self-transfer in the wet shower room; risk of falling and potential injury.
Outcome(s)(Result) : The Unit Supervisor did call a code white for The resident; the Writer and co-Behaviour Support Lead did attend; code
white cleared within 5 minutes. The male resource nurse did provide support, spoke calmly with the resident, engaged in conversation and
validated his feelings in the moment. The resident was given his PRN Quetiapine from the Unit Supervisor. Care was rendered. The resident
was brought to his room for quiet time to settle and reboot as this is known to be helpful.
Substitute Decision Maker notified (if not, explain) : POA was notified by the Unit Supervisor.

walk around the room. The staff (3) did attempt to have the resident sit back onto his bed upon arrival; however, the Writer directed the staff to
step back and allow him space. The resident was in his brief (no other clothing), socks and shoes on, seated on his bed. The Writer and staff
debriefed quietly outside his room, where the Writer instructed them to let him be for awhile. 5-10 minutes later, the Writer approached the
resident; he was still seated on his bed; allowed Writer to come in and speak with him. The Writer spent some time talking with him, however
difficult to understand his words at times; allowed the Writer to apply a shirt and pants; agreed to go off the unit for a walk. The resident
suddenly took left arm and attempted to strike out at Writer. The resident then stood up, and did lost balance onto side of his

Approx. 15 minutes later, MD was present in the building and went to see the resident; again, calm and cooperative with the MD, describing

Type of Behaviour : Physical Aggressive Behaviour
Antecedent/Triggers : Staff attended to provide care; resident appeared agitated.
Describe the behaviour : Approximately 2200h,Two PSWs attended to provide personal care for the resident. While the writer and other staff
were in the nursing station, yelling and screaming were heard coming from the direction of the resident?s area. The emergency bell was
activated. Staff, including the writer, responded immediately and found the resident in co-residents O.W. and A.S.?s washroom.
The resident was observed shouting, ?Don?t enter! Don?t enter!? and appeared highly agitated. Upon exiting the washroom, the resident
began running toward staff. PSWs reported that the resident subsequently entered co-resident S.C.?s room.
The resident was then seen in the hallway wearing only a t-shirt and a brief, making a punching fist motion while approaching staff. The
resident continued to display physically responsive behaviors, including throwing items, banging objects against the nursing station windows
and doors, kicking items, and pacing around the area.
These behaviors persisted for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes despite staff redirection and de-escalation efforts.

leading to distress and raising safety concerns for staff. Due to the resident’s aggression and refusal, staff were unable to provide the required
care.

escalation, the on-call MD was notified, and 911 was contacted.

injury, and disrupted the well-being of co-residents.
Outcome(s)(Result) : Resident was sent to the Hospital
Substitute Decision Maker notified (if not, explain) : Yes
