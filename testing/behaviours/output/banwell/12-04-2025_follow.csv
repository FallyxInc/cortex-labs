,"Sinadinovski, Radmila",2025-12-04,10:49:00,,"Behaviour Displayed : Writer received follow up report from GMHOT recommendations are as follows: 1.As much as possible,using serbian speaking staff would be beneficial.Also,stating very clearly what the staff are going to do before they do something may help prevent fear based agitation,which i witnessed today. 2.It may be helpful for the patient to have a robotic pet,if available.Daughter said she may look into it herself.The patient seems to be seeking social contact and grew up with animals,so sometimes this can be comforting. 3.Please continue to monitor for pain and optimize bowel regimen.Her bowel function is likely diminished as she is spending most of her time sitting down.Also she is at risk of increased pain given her immobility(for example,pressure sores). 4.As she is minimally mobile right now,which can exacerbate various issues,i recommend physiotherapy for her if possible,even if she just tolerates passive range of motion exercises.But if possible,getting her up to walk regularly would be ideal.

If both brexpiprazole and nabilone have not been helpful,i would begin by tapering and then stopping nabilone over the course of 1 week, waiting 3 days and then tapering and stopping brexpiprazole over the course of another week.After the taper of brexpiprazole you can proceed with increasing quetiapine as below.If both nabilone and brexpiprazole have been beneficial,you can simply proceed with quetiapine increase right away Quetiapine can be increased every 4 days in 12.5 mg increments to either the daytime or nighttime dose,depending on the pattern of symptoms.It seems PRN's are mostly given in the mornings,so increasing the morning dose first may be ideal.For now i recommend a maximum of 100 mg of quetiapine daily from ALL sources (including PRN's).The titration should be based on tolerability,with particular attention paid to oversedation risks.Potential side effects include sedation,orthostatic hypotension,falls,weight gain,hyperglycemia,and hyperlipidemia.Quetiapine may cause extrapyramidal symptoms though has lower risk of this compared to other antipsychotics.There is a rare risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome or seizure,and in patients with dementia there is a small increase in risk of mortality. In addition,if not recently done,an ECG is recommended prior to starting quetiapine given the risk of QT interval. For monitoring lipid profile,fasting glucose,HbA1c,weight,BMI and blood pressure can be checked every 3 months,if within goals of care. The switch from quetiapine can be done by tapering quetiapine in 12.5 mg increments every 4 days,while simultaneously increasing risperidone by 0.125 mg every 4 days.The maximum daily dose should be 1 mg from all sources.Risperidone can be given BID or as a single evening dose,depending on the timing of symptoms.Risk are similar to those stated above,with a higher risk of EPS and lower risk of sedation. I have not booked follow-up but please feel free to re-refer for future issues. Upon reviewing follow up report recommendations. 1.Resident has been provided with serbian cue cards staff who speak Serbian are utilized when available. 2.Robotic dog was trialled in the past with resident and was unsuccessful,resident would just hand it back to staff. 3.Team currently monitors for pain and bowel regime regularly. 4.Physiotherapy has been trialed in the past with no success.1:1 Staff will encourage resident to walk daily as tolerated.
