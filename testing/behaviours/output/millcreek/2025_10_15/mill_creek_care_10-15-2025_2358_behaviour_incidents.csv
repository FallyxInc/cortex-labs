10/01/2025 10:14,"WILSON, IRENE",Physician Note,"Note Text : Family meeting held today with resident's POA/husband David. Reason for meeting to discuss resident's health condition, goals of care, recent test results. David indicates that he notices changes in resident, such as less smiling, less interactive withothers, often does not recognize husband. Due to BPSD with restlessness, exit seeking, anxiety/agitation at times David continues to visit frequently in an effort to assist with her behavior. He expressed concern that she may end up physically restrained. Education provided, physical restraints will not be used in the home. Goals are to minimize behaviours of risk and to minimize symptoms that have a negative impact for quality of life for the resident. Recent consultation with Dr. Daniel reviewed, withchanges from Risperidone to Olanzapine. David acknowledges some improvement seems to be noted but he is concern that resident had agitation with aggression over the weekend. Subsequently, Olanzapine was increased to 7.5 mg daily and Dr. Daniel indicated possible titration up to 10 mg po daily. Education provided about dementia, BPSD, dynamic symptoms, need for adjustments to medications, etc. After much reflexion, discussion with resident's sister and discussion with his spiritual counsellor, as well as the care team at Sunnybrook Hospital, David has decided to cancel any further follow-up with Sunnybrook(regarding malignancy). We discussed dementia as a terminal illness as well as cancer as a terminal illness, and the likelihood that resident would not tolerate many appointments, investigations, treatment etc, and she may not gain any quality of life. Recent U/S shows increase in size of liver lesion, as well as possible increase in size of pancreatic head. David acknowledges that this may represent progression of metastatic disease. Wishes for a palliative approach to care with no further follow-up or workup by Sunnybrook are confirmed. Goals of care at this point will be for quality of life, comfort and symptom management. Meeting took place between 1125 and 1150. Dictated by Dr. Lee Andersen dictated but not read [e-SIGNED] Page 3 of 3"
