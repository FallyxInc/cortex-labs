I have read your description of Ms. Clarke. Her symptoms are typical of someone with advanced Parkinson'sdisease. I agree with your plan. I would suggest the following. 1. Be aware that she will have supine hypertension in addition to her sitting or standing hypotension. I see that you have ordered amlodipine for this. It is a very acceptable approach. Captopril could be used, or an overnight nitrogylcerin patch if you need a shorter acting solution. 2. Consider changing the levodopa/carbidopa from 2 tabs 3 times daily to 1.5 tabs 4 times daily. This smearing of the the dose may be able to maintainher physical function while improving the orthostatic lightheadedness. 3. You may need to treat the orthostatic hypotension. Given her history of hypertensive urgency I understand any reticence in doing so. Under the circumstances if you were to try something it would likely be best to try pyridostigmine. This can help standing hypotension without aggravating supine hypertension. Typically I would start with a testing of 30 mg twice daily, watching for secretions or diarrhea. Bradycardia is possible but unlikely. If it was well-tolerated I would try 60 mg 3 times daily. Sincerely, Stuart Reid Page 1 of 4 Note Effective Date Range: 09/01/2025 to 09/30/2025 Effective Time Range: All Created Date Range: All Created Time Range: All Author: All Department: All Resident Name : CLARKE, BETTY (288578) Location : 2 206 B Admission 06/04/2025 Date : involving cognitive functions and awareness(R41.88)",No Previous Injuries,No Injury

RFR: Goals of care. Asked by MRP team to see for urgent same day consult as reported family strongly wished to see palliative care today. Seen by our palliative care team Dr. Siemens on August 28th who optimized PRN medications and patient gave permission to speak with family as needed. DIAGNOSIS: In the past several months there has been progressive slurring of speech and swelling of left neck. Intermittently having difficulty eating. Found to have blood on pillowcase, sent to dentist who found a large oropharyngeal lesion and sent him to the ER. No stridor in ER but was having difficulty lying down. A CT scan of his head and neck revealed a large exophytic and infiltrative mass from the base of the tongue slightly eccentric to the left side. It measures approximately 5.9 x 3 x 6 cm. Admitted under ENT on August 27th. HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: Since admission, ENT performed scope via nasal cavity: ""no pus/polyps, nasopharynx with old blood crust. Oropharynx revealed significant narrowing on the left side with exophytic tumour occupying the left oropharynx/GT sulcus and extending along the left BOT and beyond midline. Unable to visualize the valleculae with tumour effacing the epiglottis partly posterior. The scope was advanced along the right pharynx below the epiglottis rim which revealed complete laryngeal structures to be intact including normal vocal cords with appropriate symmetric movement. No laryngeal lesions were notified.""

A G tube has been inserted with feeds running and NG tube was removed. Had one episode of bleeding Aug 29th overnight managed with 1g of TXA then switched to TXA mouthwash. GIM was consulted for ?atrial fibrillation, had various recommendations for medical work-up and stated ""recommend holding off on initiation of anticoagulation while diagnostic/surgical planning is underway and while his goals of care are being established with palliative care."" Mr. Lanzillottawho goes by ""Lino"" was seen on the ward today, accompanied by his two sons (Tony and Greg). Lino was tired and did not wish to talk today, has given us permission to speak with his sons. SYMPTOM ASSESSMENT: 1.Fatigue: Generally more tired since admission, less active than baseline but still able to get up and go for walks with his family on the ward. 2.Sleep: Sleeping more through the day and was awake most of last night, mildly restless and confused asking about ""I want to eat a plate of spaghetti"". No agitation or severe restlessness. Tried melatonin once two nights ago, didn't think it was very helpful. 3.Confusion: Mildly confused at moments over the past few days such as asking questions repeatedly about when he can eat or getting confused with days/times. Recognizes family and their names. No agitation. Was able to play Italian cards today. 4.Intake: Unable to tolerate PO intake so he had a G tube inserted. Thus far has been tolerating feeds without reported nausea, diarrhea, reflux or bloating. 5.Bleeding: A few nights ago had oral bleeding that resolved with TXA 1g, now has oral TXA mouthwash TID. He also suctions periodically blood tinged mucous or saliva. No significant bleeding. 6.Bowels: Reports they do not think he has had a BM since admission. As per RN notes, last BM was Aug 27th.

Ambulated with a walker, was mostly independent but received some support from LTC when needed for ADLs such as bathing. Family primarily managing iADLs. Since being in hospital needing help with most ADLs, in the context of having the NG tube and now a recently inserted G tube, ambulating with walker. Sons have been helping him get into chair at bedside. Primarily using urinal instead of getting up to washroom. SOCIAL HISTORY: Born in Italy, primarily Italian speaking. Hearing impairment. His wife died 17 years ago. Has 3 sons (Tony, Greg and Aldo). Multiple grandchildren. Retired electrician. No active substance usereported. INVESTIGATIONS: Labs: Hgb 77 (stable). Cr 61. CT-HEAD&NECK (Aug 27): Suboptimal study. There is a large oropharyngeal mass centered in the base of tongue with near focal obliteration of the oropharyngeal airway. Multiple metastatic left sided neck nodes. Some with early features of extracapsular extension. The overall appearance favours primary mucosal squamous cell carcinoma with lymphadenopathy. The differential diagnosis could include a lymphoproliferative disorder. It measuresapproximately 5.9 x 3 x 6 cm CT-CHEST: There are no mediastinal nodules or masses. No lymphadenopathy within the thorax. A nodal conglomerate in the left lower neck was partially imaged. Please refer to uncommitted head and neck CT for further detail. No thoracic metastatic disease. Mild progression of reticular interstitial lung abnormalities. For attention on follow-up. PHYSICAL EXAM: O2 97% on RA Sleeping through most of our visit, woke easily to voice. Calm, pleasant, appears comfortable. Muffled speech. Small amount of dark brown tinged sputum. No audible stridor while awake but mild snoring when asleep. No resp distress, no audible secretions. No signs of discomfort. PALLIATIVE PERFORMANCE SCALE: 40-50% PROGNOSIS: Uncertain, need further information for accurate prognostication. Family reporting rapid growth of mass is more concerning for a rapid trajectory. SUBSTITUTE DECISION MAKER: Reported that POA for personal care is joint sons Tony and Greg (form not available to review today) GOALS OF CARE: Unable to assess directly with Lino as he was fatigued after being out of bed most of the afternoon. I explored illness understanding with his sons Tony and Greg with consent. Aware that mass is likely to be malignant, and Lino himself is aware of this ""he knows it is serious"". They are uncertain what to expect in the future. Lino is described as ""a very get up and go positive attitude"", he has told his sons ""don't worry I'll be Page 3 of 5 Note Effective Date Range: 09/01/2025 to 09/30/2025 Effective Time Range: All Created Date Range: All Created Time Range: All Author: All Department: All Resident Name : LANZILLOTTA, NOVELLINO (288567) Location : Admission 02/24/2025 Date : Unspecified dementia(F03) fine just watch me and tell me what I need todo"". Values independence and dignity, but also voiced that doing what he can to live longer is important. Everyone is still processing the news from last week. Code status: Joint POA's Tony and Greg said they had discussed with dad and agreed that aggressive or invasive measures such as CPR and intubation would not be within his wishes as he is not someone who would wish to be in hospital bedbound for a prolonged period of time. At present Lino's presumed full code status and according to chart GOC on admission with patient ""We had a thorough conversation regarding patient's wishes and goals if this is biopsy confirmed to be malignancy. At this time the patient wished to proceed with all possible life preserving measures."" Not able to address with patient directly today. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Mr. Lanzillotta is a 94 yo man with newly diagnosed left Oropharyngeal Mass and metastatic lymphadenopathy suspicious for malignancy with moderate to significant oropharyngeal narrowing, biopsy results pending. Recent G tube insertion for nutrition. I was asked to see for same day weekend consult to assist with goals of care, though family did not have specific questions for me today and rather are waiting for further medical information. Symptoms are relatively minimal and well managed at the present time. PLAN: 1.Constipation: Last BM date unclear but reports no BM since admission. No signs/symptoms of obstruction and minimal intake x1 week. Recommend bisacodyl suppository PRN x1 followed by asneeded oral bowel regimen. If not effective, consider AXR to assess fecal loading. 2.Oral bleeding: On oral TXA mouthwash. Consider biotene oral spray PRN to assist with dry mouth. 3.?Delirium: I wonder if the sleep wake cycle reversal and mild confusion could be a mild hypoactive delirium. Reports of mild restlessness last night but no severe agitation. We discussed non pharm measures such as frequent reorientation, cognitive stimulation in day time, avoiding naps, being near window, calm setting, optimize bowels, using pocket talker. Will add melatonin 5mg po qHS nightly to start. I spoke with ENT MRP team and they would prefer we not add additional PRN for sleep/restlessness unless needed. 4.Goals of Care: See above. Lino was too fatigued to participate in conversation today, with consent spoke to joint POAs for personal care Tony and Greg. Good illness understanding. Will benefit from further information delivery once available such as expected trajectory, if there is a risk of sudden respiratory or vascular compromise, biopsy results, etc. to facilitate further conversations. Thus far goals have been medically active with patient stating he would want all life preserving measures. As per two sons, they all decided code status of DNR aligned with values. I have updated ENT team but would recommend confirming with patient directly tomorrow, therefore I did not update the order sheet tonight. Please note: Lino is primarily Italian speaking and has hearing impairment, recommend using translation and pocket talker.

Management includes IV pantoprazole, GI consult for endoscopy in the morning, NPO after midnight, and obtaining consent for endoscopy. • Anemia: Likely secondary to blood loss from UGIB. Initial haemoglobin (Hb) was 66; patient received 2 units of PRBC. Ongoing monitoring with a target Hb greater than 70. • Leukocytosis with Neutrophilia: Could be reactive or infectious. No clear localized infection, though there are some poorly defined constitutional symptoms. Blood and urine cultures, viral swabs, and chest X-ray have been ordered. • Hyperglycaemia from Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM): Admission glucose was 21.7, now improved to 13.0 after insulin administration.
