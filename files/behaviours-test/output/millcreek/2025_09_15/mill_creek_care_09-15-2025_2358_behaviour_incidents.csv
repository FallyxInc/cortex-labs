Initially blood was noted with a bowel movement and subsequently blood had been noticed on her incontinence product. She does not have a history of lower GI diagnoses or GI bleed. She is not on a blood thinner. Bowel movements documented as regular, stools usually soft to formed. She had no apparent pain, intakes stable. O/E resident was seen resting quietly in her bed. Eyes open, nystagmus noted, pupils somewhat fixed and dilated. She was not able to answer any questions pertaining to vision, and did not seem to have any response to sudden movements in her near field of vision. Abdomen soft and benign. No visible abnormalities on assessment of anal lesion. Skin intact. No bleeding at this time. Update provided to POA/son by phone. Rectal bleeding quite possibly related to hemorrhoids, but cannot rule out other underlying etiology including more serious diagnosis such as malignancy. Son aware. Given impression of chronic disease, frailty, dementia, etc., POA identified that conservative management in the home with a focus on palliative approach and comfort are the goals for this resident at this time. No aggressive investigations or interventions, and plan for care in the home rather than transfer to hospital should her health condition decline. We also reviewed resident's vision. Sometime ago, there appeared to be ocular erythema but resident was persistent about keeping her eyes close, and further assessment was not possible. POA wished for conservative approach/expectant management. At this time, it appears that resident has had significant vision loss and is likely blind. POA indicates that he does not wish to proceed with further investigations such as via optometry/ophthalmology assessment. Lower GI bleed, likely hemorrhoids. Monitor for any further health concerns. Significant vision loss. Palliative approach. Dictated by Dr. Lee Andersen dictated but not read [e-SIGNED]",No Previous Injuries,No Injury

09/04/2025 10:10,"PEARSE, CAROLE",Physician Note,"LATE ENTRY Note Text : Assessed on medical rounds. Resident has reported some urinary frequency including nocturia. She is slightly vague as a historian but it seems that this has been ongoing for months. She indicates that frequency improved when she was most recently treated for UTI but since symptoms have returned. No other lower UT symptoms noted. Most recent urine culture positive for ESBL, E.coli. It was discussed with resident that her seemingly chronic lower UTI symptoms may represent irritable bladder/detrusor instability or other cause for incontinence and may not be resulting from a UTI. Options are to continue to monitor for any urinary symptoms or trial treatment based on C&S results. However, if resident's symptoms persists despite antibiotic treatment, then they are not attributable to UTI. Resident indicated that she would like to trial additional course of antibiotics. Fosfomycin 3 grams po q2days times four doses has been ordered. Resident also expressed concern regarding her continence management, availability of pull-ups.

Resident has an order for prn Clearlax for which she has not been using. She is also on Senokot routinely. Clearlax will be discontinued, and Lactulose prn has been ordered. During recent hospitalization, oral Diclofenac was changed to Coltracine, I am not sure if this was due to hospital pharmacy formulary. Coltracine is not covered, so we will revert to oral Diclofenac. Additionally resident was started on Cyclobenzaprine during recent hospitalization, presumably in an effort to improve pain management after fall/right femur fracture.

Action : As per the Unit Supervisor, the resident is frequently being repositioned in his wheelchair and also while in bed for offloading purposes. Previous information was thought to be that the resident's wheelchair could be a cause of the pressure, however, speaking with the Physiotherapist, the wheelchair is not the culprit; it's a repositioning piece and how the resident often shifts his position due to poor trunk control. Following the assessment, the recommendation was to reposition the resident hourly via mechanical lift. Response : The Writer called the resident's sister, Paola (POA for Personal Care) to update on the skin condition along with recommended intervention. During conversation, Paola expressed she felt that hourly reposition via mechanical lift will cause the resident too much stress which can further lead to seizures due to stress levels. She agreed for hourly reposition, however suggested to use the lift at a minimum and would rather have a 2 person manual reposition while in his wheelchair. The Writer explained that not all staff feel comfortable with this due to strength abilities but we'd do our best to accommodate this request; Paola very appreciative of the call and update provided.
