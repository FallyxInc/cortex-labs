I think you bring some genuine concerns about using GLP-1 in this patient and I agree with you I would probably avoid Ozempic, given higher risk of aspiration, and in addition GLP-1 have been associated with higher risk of gallstones. From the renal perspective you already have her on RAS blockade which is excellent. I think in terms of renal perspective I would recommend adding SGLT-2, either Empagliflozin 10 mg daily or Dapagliflozin 10 mg daily. I guess the only concern is limited data for using SGLT-2 with G-tubes, but mechanistically can't think of any concerns. Other then that, I think rest of medications seem appropriate, and I agree with reducing dose of Tenofovir. From a renal perspective would monitor Serum Creatinine, electrolytes, urine ACR on a 6 month basis.

She has a history of type II Diabetes and CKD. Due to declining renal function I have maintained fairly tight glycemic control. Her eGFR continues to decline, so I explored the possibility of adding semaglutide. The following issues give me pause however: 1. G-tube feeds and the delayed gastric emptying as a riskfor aspiration 2. A history of hiatus hernia, also increasing aspiration risk 3. A history of pancreatitis requiring ICU admission I decreased her Tenofovir for her Hepatitis B to 150mg per day. Kindly advise what further steps might safely be taken to optimize/protect renal function without significant risk. Is semaglutide still an option? Many thanks for your kind recommendations.
